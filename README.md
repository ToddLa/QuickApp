# QuickApp
As close to a single file iOS app as you can get. 

## Usage
1. Copy QuickApp.xcodeproj to a new directory.
2. Open project, add a new Swift or ObjC file with a class named "MainViewController" or "TestViewController"
    - if you don't want a UINavigationController name your class "RootViewController"
3. Change the Product Name (aka Display Name) in the Project properties (optional)
    - change the Team and BundleID if you want to run on a device.
4. Build and Run.
